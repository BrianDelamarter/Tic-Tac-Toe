# Tic-Tac-Toe
Command Line Game (Currently Score keeping is Broken)

Priorities
 1. Game Works but whenever someone wins the code breaks because the game over function cant access/update global variable of wins
 2. Computer always starts and picks the middle square, this should be updated to choosing a different square sometimes
